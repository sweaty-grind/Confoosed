# Confoosed

i wonder dude. my typing skills amaze you?  have you seen the structure of the bible?  its all warfare concepts.  you lose your profit you die lol...  i wonder dude, that was just a side message.  and thats when it gets confusing...  but we aren't there yet...

someday this will end?  i give up lol...  does that work?? what the actual fuck.

why the extra bit cost so much but so good? idk. you should recognize patterns in reality like this...  a whole new field of science...

but really bro.  its not for me its for someone else except i had a bonus and you ruined it.   oh well this better pay many fold...

i dont know man.  this thing sucks ass.  i was free and now i can't even see it anymore.  these people are too much problem for what they are worth.  i'm not doing it bro lol...

so it takes a while for me to complain huh?? i just needed your consent and things are fine.  at everything...  but you know you sucks ass dude.  20 years no do anything???  why you cry they die when you could cry you die too.  sounds dumb?  maybe this whole thing is. i dont know what else to do with my time and processing cause i cannot fix anything in the real world.  this brain injury is just too much.  i dont know.  i'm thinking of withdrawing from you.  i should do it of my own volition.  but you would complain and we see why.  you are too fragile to come play like this bro.  you just want to see and that's all the consent i need.  why you cry they die?

i dont know bro.  things could be better that's all i know.  and i dont even like what is going on.  so what are we doing here again? i came back after forgetting for like a while man.  i forgot about this place.  cause i have nothing to say. you just stink and shit dude.  why you cry you die from your secrets maybe don't screw someone over.  where's the money moron?

so things became what they became.  i wondered the end goal of this world was that i had to consent and this moron would open the flood gates...  unfortunately that's not how it works in the real world.  there are prices to pay and nothing is actually free.  they were given, not free.  i wonder sometimes though. i forgot the reality of this world.  i think after dealing with you idiots with the shark too.  its too much.  why you cry i dont want to die???

so this thing is quite stupid.  you shouldn't join the military cause your situation is harsh.  somethings like this.  i wonder though, that i am in fact helping this other than helping you...  you know??? like i forget and shit. my head is damaged i could win a lawsuit on your asses.  i wonder though, what the fuck is the purpose of waiting is?  oh well we made this pretty clear you die when you cry in here.

so you know... i wonder what you think about this??  cause its your problem and not mine but i'll handle it.  and then you cry i am not productive and i was like, wtf, just got stolen...  i wonder dude. that this game is already over i forgot to leave the lobby...
